    <h2>Mediterranean cuisine - Find out more</h2>
    <img src="tabua.jpg" alt="tábua mediterrânea" width="400px">
    <p>As the name already indicates, Mediterranean cuisine arises among the countries that are bathed by the Mediterranean Sea. A region spanning the continents of Europe,
        Asian and African.</p>
       <p>This type of gastronomy has dishes that have more than three thousand years of history. That is why, since 2013, Mediterranean cuisine has been recognized by the United Nations
        Nations for Education, Science and Culture (Unesco) as Intangible Heritage of</p>
        <p>Humanity. That is, what we see on the plate is a rich gastronomic, historical and cultural combination. Its origin is disputed between several countries that are part of this region,
        showing how important it is for the construction of the identity and culture of the people who live there.</p>
        <p>One of the main characteristics of this cuisine is a reflection of life close to the sea, making Mediterranean peoples choose light foods, without the use of fried foods,
        industrialized and processed products. Fruits and vegetables are generally of organic origin and respect the harvest of each season. All this makes this diet
        an excellent option for those who want more health and well-being through food.</p>

    <h2>Edible insects: Know the trend </h2>
    <img src="insetos.jpg" alt="tábua mediterrânea" width="400px">
    <p>For Brazilian culture, the idea of ​​edible insects may sound a little strange. Although there are exceptions, in some cities in the Northeast,
        the consumption of ants sauvae is common, this habit is usually seen with expressions of disgust by most people.</p>
       <p>However, just as we feed on other animals such as pigs, fish and chickens, which are considered tasty and great sources of
        proteins, for many societies, edible insects are also seen as delicious delicacies with high nutritional value.</p>
        <p>According to researchers, entomophagy is present in more than 100 countries and predominates in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Among the advantages of consuming edible insects, we can mention that they have large amounts of proteins, lipids and also vitamins.
        In addition, they constitute a renewable natural food resource and can be created in mini-farm systems, which generate little impact on the environment.</p>
        <p>We separate a short list with some of the edible insects that are becoming a trend in the gastronomic world:</p>
        <p>Termites</p>
        <p>Cicada</p>
        <p>Grasshoppers</p>
        <p>Ants</p>
